See your attendance status instantly with a color-coded system:

### 📊 Simplified Marks View + GPA Calculator  
All your subject marks are shown on one page for easy overview.  
And now with the built-in **GPA Calculator**, calculating your GPA has never been easier:
- Course names and credit hours are fetched automatically
